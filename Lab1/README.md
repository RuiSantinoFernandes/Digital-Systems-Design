# Digital-Systems-Design Lab 1
Objective of the Lab--
The purpose of this lab is to introduce students of CPE 487 to the NEXYS2 FPGA development board and a software environment that will allow students to design a hardware system in VHDL, synthesize their design to create an FPGA configuration file, download the configuration file on to an FPGA and
then run the configured FPGA to achieve the desired hardware functionality. This was done all through ISE Project Navigator on a virtual machine, with the tutorial shown in the Lab Manual.
