CpE 487 Digital Design Lab
Lab 1: Seven Segment Decoder
Professor: Kevin Lu
Objective-
  The purpose of this lab is to introduce students to the NEXYS2 FPGA development board and a
software environment that will allow them to design a hardware system in VHDL, synthesize their
design to create an FPGA configuration file, download the configuration file on to an FPGA and
then run the configured FPGA to achieve the desired hardware functionality.
