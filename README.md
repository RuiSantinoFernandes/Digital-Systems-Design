# Digital-Systems-Design Lab 1
Objective of the Lab
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the students of CPE 487 to the NEXYS2 FPGA development board and a
software environment that will allow the students to design a hardware system in VHDL, synthesize their
design to create an FPGA configuration file, download the configuration file on to an FPGA and
then run the configured FPGA to achieve the desired hardware functionality. This was done all through ISE 
Project Navigator with the tutorial shown in the Lab Manual.
